# Audriana Evans-Project 1-Memory Game

## **Game Description**

In this toddler friendly memory game, the goal of the game is to test your memory and find all the matching cards that is laid out on the screen. To find  a match, the player must flip two cards that are identical to one another. This will keep going until all the matches are found.

## **Technical Used**

I used HTML first to put in links to the fonts I used. I also added my title and heading as well as classes for my div to help set up my gameboard. 

I used javascript to get my game to function the way I needed it to. I used a for loop to set up my gameboard with my pictures. I used conditional statements so the computer can tell when there has or has not been a match and used dom manipulation to be able to flip the cards over to display the picture.

### **Next Steps:**

My next steps are to improve the game features by adding a start button and a instruction button for those who never played before. I would like to add a music button that you can turn on and off according to the players preference. At some point I would also like to add different themes to my game so that kids with different taste in cartoons.
